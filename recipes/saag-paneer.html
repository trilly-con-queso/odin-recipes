    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Just another amazing Indian dish. This time it's vegetarian!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 x 250g pack paneer, cut into 2cm cubes</li>
        <li>450g frozen chopped spinach</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>Â½ -1 tsp hot chilli powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With a fork, make a few holes in each paneer cube and then mix well with the marinade ingredients. You can
            fry these immediately but the paneer benefits from a longer marinating time, even overnight if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the paneer in about 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-high heat until
            nicely browned, then remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach to a saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of water, cover and cook until defrosted.</li>
        <li>Now heat the remaining oil in the frying pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the cumin seeds and stir
            them around in the oil for about 30 seconds, then add the chilli powder and turmeric. Stir in the chopped
            garlic and fry until it is light golden brown in colour. Be careful not to burn the garlic or it will turn
            bitter.</li>
    </ol>
