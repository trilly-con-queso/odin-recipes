    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is a delicious recipe full of butter <em>and</em> chicken! Who would've thought?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger (or finely grated)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes
            to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of
            two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside
            and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
        <li>Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while
            scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </li>
